# Map

The map can be loaded in [World Creator](/worldcreator) and modified if you wish.

Open CODEX and go to the World Creator. This will open with a new world. Go to File -> Open. Navigate to *stones\mapdata\Boomtown* and select this folder. Once the Boomtown map has been loaded, perform any edits and go to File -> Save. You can now load the map with your edits.
